Create a gamified investor portal called Opian Rewards, inspired by the Ascendancy Project. The website should feel like a quest-based RPG dashboard where investors choose their "player tier," track progress, and unlock rewards.

🔑 Core Features

Hero Section / Landing Page

Futuristic, AI-driven theme with tagline:
“Join the Mission. Build the Future. Claim Your Tier.”

Animated AI guide avatar (AETHER-style) that introduces the mission.

Call-to-action button: “Press START” → leads to Tier Selection.

Tier Selection (Gamified)

Show the three roles as player classes:

The Builder (R12K / grind style)

The Innovator (R24K / balanced champion, most popular)

The Visionary (R36K / all-in, high impact)

Each tier should look like a game character card with “Unlock Fee,” “Playstyle,” and a select button.

Quest Line (Progression System)

Visual timeline/level system for the Innovator Tier:

Level 1: Capital reclaimed after 24 months

Level 2: 10 years of dividends

Show progress bars, “achievement unlocked” icons, and reward summaries.

Rewards & Recognition

Digital Ascendancy Certificate (like a player card).

Exclusive Partner Badge (displayable on LinkedIn-style networks).

Priority Access unlocks (special project previews).

Mission Briefing (Risk Protocol)

Styled like an in-game warning screen with bold red/orange highlights.

Message: “Every quest has risks. No guarantees. Past performance ≠ future performance.”

Co-op Mode / Future Section

Multiplayer style: show how early partners are building the future together.

CTA: “Ready to press START?”
